Here I add features that are missing in this editor that are in vim. Many of
them will be marked as not planned but it think it is a good idea to have a
list. Also they can be implemented in user space.

# Command Line
- :ls (:file)
- :cd
- :b
- :find (path)

## :args
I think this is just bad, I make fun of having tabs windows and buffers but a
separate arg list is just not needed.
- `:next` & `:prev`
- `]a` & `[a`
- `:rewind` & `:last`
- `]A` & `[A`

- `:arglocal`
- `:argdo`

# Commands
- gf
- g<c-g>
