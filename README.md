# neomacs
a combination of many small projects I have worked on

- zano: fork of cano, rewritten in zig
- imvr/zimv: image viewer based on imv

Overall, this project aims to be everything but a web browser. And you should
(eventuall) be able to run a system with only busybox, this, ssh and firefox
installed.
